# Converters for HTML/Web

This is the source code for a wide range of JavaScript converters with a UI built on HTML/CSS.

It's designed so that anybody can use it, through a simple and understandable interface and input syntax.

## Content

### HTML
HTML: The HTML files are pure HTML with references to CSS and JS
### CSS
 CSS: Currently developing a Windows 8 "Metro"eqsue style aesthetics to aim at porting the whole project to a Windows 8 app
### JS
JS: Each different converter (for now) has its own JS, and the HTML page has its own JS file for laying out stuff

## Versions
### 2012-08
*CSS uses my own CSS template v4.1 and has additional styles on the HTML file - needs to be separated onto its own CSS file
*CSS uses browser vendor prefixes to render lots of gradients which should be minimised in the future for transition to Windows 8 "Metro"esque style for porting to Windows 8
